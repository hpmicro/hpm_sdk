tsn_stmid_frer_ingress
============================================

Overview
--------

This example shows TSN frame identification and redundant transmission (IEEE802.1 CB)

- Observe the result of the frame identification

  - After frame passes a successful identification,  a incremented sequence number will be generated by STMID module,  and then a R-Tag will be added by FRER module.

- Redundant Transmission can be implemented by multi-cast mechanism

  - Due to the limitated hardware design of the development board, this feature is not shown (There is no frame splitting functionality in TSW peripheral. )

- At the receiving end, run the sample tsn_stmid_frer_egress on another development board and observe the results of frame recovery

Board Settings
--------------

- Connect a USB port on PC to the PWR DEBUG port on the development board with a USB Type-C cable

- Connect an Ethernet port on PC to a RGMII port on the development board with an Ethernet cable

Project Configurations
----------------------

- None

Run Example
-----------

- Compiling and Downloading

- Running log is shown in the serial terminal as follows:
