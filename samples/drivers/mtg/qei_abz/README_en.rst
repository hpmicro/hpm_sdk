MTG QEI ABZ example
======================================

Overview
--------

The MTG QEI ABZ routine demonstrates the function of using a QEI ABZ type encoder as data input, processing it through MTG filters, and compensating it for time through trajectory prediction modules. The routine outputs the raw data of QEI and the data processed by MTG, and outputs the difference between the two.

Board Setting
-------------

No special settings
