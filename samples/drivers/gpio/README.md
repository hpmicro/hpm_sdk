## Running the example

When the example runs successfully, the LED will flash 5 times, then press GPIO button (please check [Button](lab_board_resource) section of specific board) will toggle the LED status, and the following message is displayed in the terminal:
```

> toggling led 1/5 times
> toggling led 2/5 times
> toggling led 3/5 times
> toggling led 4/5 times
> toggling led 5/5 times
> input interrupt
> user led will be switched on off based on user switch
