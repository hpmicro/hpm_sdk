ECAT_FOE
================

1. Overview
-----------

The ECAT_FOE example demonstrates the functionality of ECAT FOE to write and read slave files.

Using ECAT FOE to update firmware, please refer to the OTA sample in hpm_apps repo.

This routine program supports initializing the EEPROM data of the ESC, simplifying the process of updating the ESC's EEPROM.

If the program code contains EEPROM data (eeprom.h) generated by the SSC Tool, it will check the data stored in the ESC's EEPROM and update it based on conditions.

If the checksum of the EtherCAT Slave Controller Configuration Area (the first 8 words) of the EEPROM failed, the EEPROM will be initialized with the data from eeprom.h.

If the checksum of the EtherCAT Slave Controller Configuration Area (the first 8 words) of the EEPROM succeeds, will verify the Product Code and Revision Code in the EEPROM data.

When the Product Code differs or the Revision Number in eeprom.h is greater than the Revision Number of the currently stored EEPROM data, the EEPROM will be initialized with the data from eeprom.h.

This method can solve the problem of checksum failure caused by EEPROM being empty during initial use, it will initialize EEPROM. During program upgrades, if the Revision Number in the eeprom.h included in the new program code is greater than the Revision Number of the currently stored EEPROM data, the EEPROM will be initialized with the eeprom.h, eliminating the need to update the EEPROM through master station tools such as TwinCAT.

2. Prepare
----------

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample
  Software tool version: SSC Tool (SSC Version: 5.13.1; Config File Vers: 1.5.3.0)

3. Project Setting
------------------

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

  **Note** : When using FLASH to simulate EEPROM, please allocate appropriate flash space for FLASH-EEPROM content to avoid conflicts with other flash contents

4. Generate EtherCAT slave stack code
-------------------------------------

Due to licensing issues, HPMSDK does not provide EtherCAT slave protocol stack code (SSC). Users have download the SSC Tool from Beckoff's official website and generate the slave stack code according to the steps.

4.1. Download SSC Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

4.2 SSC Tool import configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  configuration file path: <hpm_sdk>/samples/ethercat/ecat_foe/SSC/Config/HPM_ECAT_FOE_Config.xml

4.3 SSC Tool create slave stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Create new project based on specified configuration
  2. Import application file: <hpm_sdk>/samples/ethercat/ecat_foe/SSC/foe.xlsx
  3. Specify the output path and generate slave stack code

5. TwinCAT Project setting
--------------------------

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

5.1. Add ESI file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Please modify the device attributes(<Device Physics="YY">) in generated ESI xml by SSC tool according to the actual number of ports, The default attribute generated in ESI is "YY", indicating that Port0 and Port1 are implemented. If Port0, Port1, and Port2 are actually implemented, please manually modify the attribute to "YYY".

  2. Copy the ESI xml to TwinCAT( **C:/TwinCAT/3.1/Config/Io/EtherCAT** ).

5.2 Create Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

5.3 Software Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

5.4 Scan device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Please refer to the README of ECAT_IO sample

5.5 Update EEPROM context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  select **foe**

5.6 FOE action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Set MailBox timeout time (when the file is large, the timeout time needs to be adjusted)

  3. Download file

    click 'Download'

    waiting for completion of writing

    4. Enter Bootstrap mode，uploade file

    click 'Uplaod'

    waiting for completion of reading

  4. quit Bootstrap mode

6. Running the example
----------------------

After the project is running correctly：

When EEPROM data needs to be initialized, the log is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   EtherCAT FOE sample
   Write or Read file from flash by FOE
   Init EEPROM content.
   Init EEPROM content successful.
   EEPROM loading successful, no checksum error.

When EEPROM data does not need to be initialized, execute file write and read operations in Twincat, comparing the written and read files to ensure consistency. The log is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   EtherCAT FOE sample
   Write or Read file from flash by FOE
   No need to init EEPROM content.
   EEPROM loading successful, no checksum error.
   Write file start
   Write file finish
   Read file start
   Read file finish
