# lv_demo_benchmark

## Overview

The benchmark demo tests the performance in various cases. For example rectangle, border, shadow, text, image blending, image transformation, bleding modes, etc. All tests are repeated with 50% opacity.

The size an position of the objects during testing are set with a pseudo random number to make the benchmark repeatable.

On to top of the screen the title of the current test step, and the result of the previous step is displayed.
